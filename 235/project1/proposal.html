            <h3>Introduction</h3>
            <p>What is Speed? Great question you beautiful person! That's what we'll be going over here, so you can better understand and enjoy the cultural revolution that is Speed!</p>

            <h3>High Concept</h3>
            <p>Speed is a game where you survive by dodging blades coming at you and accelerating to a velocity that will take you well beyond the stars*!
            <br />
            *Disclaimer: This game will not actually take you beyond the stars, nor will your velocity break any known speed barriers.**
            <br />
            **Note: For now...

            <h3>Genre</h3>
            <p>
                What genre is speed? I'm glad you had the forseight and intelligence to ask such things! Speed is an endless runner game, like Temple Run. The main difference between Speed and Temple Run is that Speed is actually a good game, while Temple Run isn't.

        <section class="platform">
            <h3>Platform</h3>
            <p>Sadly, Speed is currently only planned to work on desktop since the control scheme for mobile would be quite hard, and I can't think of a funny joke here so instead I have a picture of a dog in a hat for you.</p>
