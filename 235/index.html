            <h2>Bio</h2>

            <p class="bio">By learning how to develop for the web, I hope to increase my marketability in the job
                market. I also want to follow in the footsteps of my mother, who is also a web developer. I love video
                games, and I want to be able to make game that anyone can play, and frankly the web might just be the
                perfect way to do that. After college, I hope to have a nice-paying job for myself as I begin my journey
                into the tech and entertainment industries.</p>
